# simple-calculator-app
A simple calculator using python only. not a gui based, terminal only.

Doing this as a reason to learn python. No more chatgpt code pasting.

This should be able to do basic Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. Nothing too fancy, it says in the name "simple-calculator"

Hope I can accomplish it.

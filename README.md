# simple-calculator-app
A simple calculator using python only. not a gui based, terminal only.

At this point, I can only pre-select a number of integer inputs and hardcode the 4 basic operations using if elif and else statements. [I need be more carefull of "" and : in if, elif and else statements.]

So, simple-calculator.py can only work with 10 integers being hardcoded while calculator.py can do unlimited.

tl:dr
Doing this as a reason to learn python. No more chatgpt code pasting.

This should be able to do basic Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. Nothing too fancy, it says in the name "simple-calculator"

Hope I can accomplish it.
